- () X position

  No, adjusting this property would move the Game Object horizontally not make the Game Object move up. Think about which coordinate sets the position the up/down axis. 

  You can think of the X coordinate as across in the same way as you would when working with 2D coordinates.

- (x) Y position

  --- feedback ---

  That's right! The Y coordinate sets the Game Objects position on the up/down axis and needs to be increased to move the Game Object up.  

  When working with 2D coordinates Y is the up/down direction and it's the same in Unity.

- ( ) Z position

  No, adjusting this propery would move the Game Object horizontally not make the Game Object move up. Think about which coordinate sets the position on the up/down axis. 

  In 2D you just have X and Y coordinates. 3D adds a Z coordinate which you can think of as front to back.
