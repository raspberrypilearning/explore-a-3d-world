This GameObject is partly underneath a Plane. Which property should you change to get it to sit on top of the Plane?

- () The x position

  --- feedback ---

  No, adjusting this property would move the GameObject horizontally, not make the GameObject move up. Think about which coordinate sets the position on the up/down axis. 

  You can think of the x coordinate as across in the same way as you would when working with 2D coordinates.

- (x) The y position

  --- feedback ---

  That's right! The y coordinate sets the GameObject's position on the up/down axis and needs to be increased to move the GameObject up.  

  When working with 2D coordinates y is the up/down direction, and it's the same in Unity.

- ( ) The z position

  --- feedback ---

  No, adjusting this property would move the GameObject horizontally, not make the GameObject move up. Think about which coordinate sets the position on the up/down axis. 

  In 2D, you just have x and y coordinates. 3D adds a z coordinate, which you can think of as front to back.
