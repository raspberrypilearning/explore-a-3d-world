<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
Unity uses the <span style="color: #0faeb0">**C#**</span> (pronounced C sharp) programming language which is used by professional software developers. C# is an object-oriented language with **classes** that define behaviour for similar objects and **methods** which are functions that belong to a class. In Unity, a **script** defines a class with variables and methods. You can add the same script to multiple GameObjects if they need the same features.</p>

--- task ---

Click on your character in the Hierarchy window or Scene view so you can see its properties in the Inspector window. 

Click 'Add Component' and start to type `character` in the Search box, click on the 'CharacterController' component when it appears: 

![The Add Component menu showing character controller](images/character-controller-add.png)

--- /task ---

The CharacterController component adds new features to your Player GameObject including a `SimpleMove` method and a **collider**. Colliders can be used to stop your character walking through solid objects and to detect when collisions take place.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
 A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**collider**</span> is a shape that is used to detect when a GameObject collides, or intersects, with another GameObject. It's much quicker for a computer to check for collisions with a simple collider shape than the complex shape of a GameObject.</p>

--- task ---

The Character Controller collider has a Height of `2` and a centre at `0, 0, 0` this means it is positioned half above and half below the plane: 

![The scene view showing the character with a Character Controller capsule around the model](images/scene-char-controller.png){:width="300px"}

Your character has a height of `1` meaning their centre on the y-axis is at `0.5`. Change the value in the Character Controller y-axis centre to `0.5` and the Height to `1` to match the character:

Your character needs a script so that the player can move it around. You'll need a code editor installed on your computer, to edit this script.

--- task ---

[[[unity-visual-studio]]]

Go to the Inspector window for the Player and click on the 'Add Component' button. Type `script` and select 'New Script'. Name your new script `PlayerController`, then press 'Enter'.

The new script will be saved in the 'Assets' folder:

![The Project Window with new My Scripts folder shown.](images/new-script-project.png){:width="400px"}

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Double-click on 'PlayerController' in the script component in the Inspector. The script will open in a separate code editor and have this code: 

--- code ---
---
language: c#
filename: PlayerController.cs
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 
line_highlights: 
---
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
--- /code ---

**Debug:** Check that the name after 'class' is `PlayerController` and matches the name of your script file. If you rename the file after creating it then you will need to change the class name in the script.

--- /task ---

The 'Start' method is called once when you play your scene. Add code to print the message `Player started` when your project starts running.

--- task ---

Use the `Debug.Log()` method to print a message when the Player GameObject's `Start` method is called. The message will appear in the bar at the bottom of the Unity editor and in the Console window:

```
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        Debug.Log("Player started");
    }
```

**Tip:** The lines starting with // are comments that explain the code. You donâ€™t need to type them.

**Save** your 'PlayerController' script in your code editor, using 'Ctrl-S' (or 'Cmd-S'), then return to the Unity Editor. The Unity Editor will load your script to get it ready to run, this may take a few seconds. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Click on the Console window tab to bring it to the front:

![The tab for the Console window highlighted in the bottom left section of the Unity editor.](images/console-window.png){:width="400px"}

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Go to the Toolbar and click on the **Play** button to put your scene into Playmode. This will simulate your scene as it would be viewed and interacted with by a user:  

![The Toolbar at the top of the Unity Editor with Play button highlighted.](images/play-button.png){:width="400px"}

Unity takes a few seconds to start up, then you should see the `Debug.Log()` 'Player started' output in the Console. 

![The console window with the time stamped 'Player started' message as a comment.](images/player-started.png)

Click the 'Play' button again to exit Playmode and the debug output will stop.

**Debug:** Your scene won't play if there are errors in your code. Check the Console window for information. You may see:
+ '; expected' - check for a semicolon `;` at the end of each line of code. 
+ 'Newline in constant' - you missed a quote `"` from the end of a text string.
+ '} expected' - you should have a pair of open and close curly brackets `{}` around each method and around the class. Check that your curly brackets match.
+ ') expected' - make sure there's a closing `)` at the end of each Method call, before the semicolon.
+ 'Debug' does not contain a definition for 'log'' - C# is case sensitive, it needs to be `Log` with a capital `L`.

Compare your code with the example code and make sure everything is exactly the same.

--- /task ---

Unity creates the effect of movement by quickly drawing images to the screen. Each image is a **frame**. The `Update` method is called once every frame.

--- task ---

You will be able to use WASD or arrow keys (players on mobile or console can use different inputs without you changing your code.)

`Input.GetAxis("Vertical")` takes input from 'W'/'S' or up/down arrow keys and returns a number between '1' and '-1' which we will use for forwards/backwards movement. 

<mark>Add line numbers, filenames and highlights to code markdown.</mark>

```
void Update()
{
        float speed = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

        if (speed != 0) // Player moving
        {
            Debug.Log(speed);
        }
}
```

A `float` is a decimal number.

**Save** your 'PlayerController' script in your code editor, using 'Ctrl-S' (or 'Cmd-S'), then return to the Unity Editor.

<mark>Do we want to be specific about the editor?</mark>

**Tip:** You might finding it quicker to use 'Alt-Tab' (or 'Cmd-Tab') to switch between your Web browser with the project instructions, the Unity editor and your code editor.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:**  Go to the Toolbar and click on the 'Play' button to put your scene into Playmode.

Place your **mouse pointer in the Game view** and press keys `W` and `S`. Look at the values logged in the Console window as you press the keys. Each time you press `W` a positive number is logged, when you press `S` a negative number is logged. 

The numbers range between -1.0 and 1.0 and correspond to movement from the vertical controls on the keyboard (or a games controller). You can also use the up and down arrow keys.

![The Console window with 5 log entries that have values between -1 and 1.](images/console-values.png)

**Tip:** The output also appears in the bar at the bottom on the Unity editor. 

Click the 'Play' button again to exit Playmode and the debug output will stop.

--- /task ---

The 'CharacterController' component provides a `SimpleMove` method.

--- task ---

Update your code to use the Vertical input value to move the player each frame. (You can remove the 'Debug' line.)

A Unity `Vector3` is used to store 3D points or directions. The `forward` variable stores the direction that the player is facing in:

```
    void Update()
    {
        float speed = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");        
        
        // forward is the forward direction for this character
        Vector3 forward = transform.TransformDirection(Vector3.forward);

        // We need the CharacterController so we can use SimpleMove
        CharacterController controller = GetComponent<CharacterController>();       
        controller.SimpleMove(forward * speed);
    }
 ```
 
 <mark>Include ingredient on Vector3?</mark>

--- /task ---

--- task ---
**Test:** Click Play to enter Playmode and try out your code. Use W/S or up and down arrow keys to glide forwards and backwards. 

**Debug:** Remember to check the Console window for helpful messages. Check brackets, semicolons and capital letters in your code carefully.

**Tip:** Make sure your mouse pointer is in the **Game view**.

Try and walk through the wall. The `SimpleMove` Method from the `CharacterController` component stops you from being able to walk through GameObjects that have a collider. A collider is automatically added when you create a 3D shape as you did for the Wall. 

You can pan around in the **Scene view** by holding your right-mouse button and dragging. Pan to get a better view of the wall as your character walks into it:

![Scene and game view of character up against the wall.](images/player-wall.gif){:width="500px"}

To move your player, move the mouse pointer back to the **Game view**.

Click the 'Play' button again to exit Playmode.

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Add another line so your character can `Rotate` when the player presses A/D or the left and right arrow keys: 

```
void Update()
    {
        float speed = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

        // Rotate around y - axis
        transform.Rotate(0, Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"), 0);
```

Save your code and switch back to the Unity editor. Unity will load your updated Script.

--- /task ---

--- task ---
**Test:** Click 'Play' to enter Playmode and try out your code. Use A/D or left and right arrow keys to rotate. 

**Debug:** If you are still seeing output to the console and movement isn't working, then make sure you have saved your script in the code editor.

Click the 'Play' button again to exit Playmode.

--- /task ---

You can also control the speed of movement and rotation.

--- task ---

Open your 'PlayerController' script and add variables for the `moveSpeed` and `rotateSpeed`:

```
public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    float moveSpeed = 4.0f; // f at the end of the number says it is a floating point number
    float rotateSpeed = 1.5f;
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---

Update the code to `Rotate` and `SimpleMove` your character to multiple by the new variables:

```
        transform.Rotate(0, Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * rotateSpeed, 0);
```

and,

```
        controller.SimpleMove(forward * speed * moveSpeed);
```
--- /task ---

It's easy to forget whether your game is playing or not. A Playmode colour tint makes it easier to tell when your scene is playing:

![Side my side image of the Unity editor without tint and with tint.](images/tint-no-tint.png)

--- task ---

To set a tint, go to the 'Edit Menu' (or 'Unity Menu') and select 'Preferences'. Choose the 'Colours' menu and find the property called 'Playmode tint'.

Click on the existing colour to see a colour wheel where you can choose a colour and opacity level:

![The colour wheel pop up window with a blue medium opacity tint selected.](images/tint-colour-window.png){:width="400px"}

**Tip:** Try a light colour so that you can still clearly see the text in the editor when the scene is running. 

Return to the Unity editor and press the **Play** button to see your new tint in action. When you are happy with the tint you have chosen, press the **Play** button again to exit Playmode.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Play your scene and check if you are happy with the speed settings. 

Make changes to 'moveSpeed' and 'rotateSpeed' in your script until you are happy. 

**Tip:** You can comment out the `Debug.Log()` lines by putting `//` at the beginning of the line. 
You can also comment out multiple lines using `/*` and `*/`:
```
        /*if (speed != 0) // Player moving
        {
            Debug.Log(speed);
        }*/
```

Click the 'Play' button again to exit Playmode.
