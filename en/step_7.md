<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">

</div>
</div>

You can: 
+ add more 3D objects to your world, try Spheres and Capsule 
+ try different colours and materials
+ change the Scale settings for the Transform for your character to make it bigger or smaller - you'll need to change all three values to keep it in proportion
+ enable and disable different accessories in the Inspector window to get the look you want
+ adjust the player movement and rotation speed
+ adjust the position of the camera
