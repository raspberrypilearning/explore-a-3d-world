## Upgrade your project

Now you can make your 3D world just the way you want it.

You can: 
+ add more 3D objects to your world, try Spheres and Capsule 
+ try different colours and materials
+ change the Scale settings for the Transform for your character to make it bigger or smaller - you'll need to change all three values to keep it in proportion
+ enable and disable different accessories in the Inspector window to get the look you want
+ adjust the player movement and rotation speed
+ adjust the position of the camera
