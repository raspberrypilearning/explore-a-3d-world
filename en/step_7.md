## Upgrade your project

Now you can make your 3D world just the way you want it.

You can: 
+ Add more 3D objects to your world, try Spheres and Capsules 
+ Try different colours and materials
+ Change the Scale settings or the Transform values for your character to make it bigger or smaller â€” you'll need to change all three values to keep it in proportion
+ Enable and disable different accessories in the Inspector window to get the look you want
+ Adjust the Player movement and rotation speed
+ Adjust the position of the camera
