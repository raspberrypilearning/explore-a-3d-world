If you are following the [Introduction to Unity](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/unity-intro) pathway, you can move on to the [Star Collector](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/star-collector) project. In this project, you will make a minigame where you collect stars that are hidden around a 3D map.
