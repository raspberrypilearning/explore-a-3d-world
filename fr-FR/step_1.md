## Introduction

Create a 3D world in Unity and explore it with an animated 3D player character.

This project is brought to you with generous support from [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/){:target="_blank"}.  These [projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/unity-intro){:target="_blank"} offer young people the opportunity to take their first steps in creating virtual worlds using Real-Time 3D.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Unity**</span> is a development environment for making games, virtual environments, visual novels, digital animations, and more. You can use Unity to develop 2D and 3D cross-platform games for PCs, consoles, mobile devices, and the internet.
</p>

You will:
+ Understand the Unity environment including the Scene editor
+ Add 3D objects with materials as scenery
+ Create a player character with animations that can move around

### Recommended previous experience
This project is suitable for learners with previous coding experience, such as [Scratch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/scratch-intro){:target="_blank"} or [Python](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/python-intro){:target="_blank"}, who are comfortable typing text-based code.

### You will need
This project requires the Unity Editor, which can be installed from the Unity Hub. This is a large download and install, so we recommend you install it before starting this project.

You can follow our [Unity guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/unity-guide){:target="_blank"} to install Unity Hub and the Unity Editor for your operating system.

You will also need to download the [Unity starter package](https://rpf.io/p/en/explore-a-3d-world-go){:target="_blank"} of assets before starting.
